He didn’t think much about it and assumed he could sit it off watching television. Within an hour he became more ill. He decided he would sleep it off.
						</p>
						<p>
							Aaron headed towards his bedroom through the kitchen. He started to feel dizzy. He collapsed. "I did a slow fall trying to catch myself. It was like a bad dream where your muscles kind of go weak and you can't do anything." His heart was racing "a million miles an hour," and his head was throbbing. He thought he was having a heart attack.
						</p>
						<p>
							He passed out on the kitchen floor. After some time,  Aaron gathered himself and got up. He took aspirin—a suggested quick-response that’s advised for people who think they’re having a heart attack. Aaron is young and active, so he wasn’t sure if this was an actual incident. He proceeded with the plan to sleep it off. This might have been the worst idea, because carbon monoxide is a night time killer.

							Aaron’s incident occurred on the first day the heater was used in the fall. A repairman that had recently visited the home for an annual checkup had forgotten to place the cover back on the heater. Without the cover carbon monoxide began to leak into the home. Most systems won’t even run without it, but Aaron’s was so old that it didn’t have the safety feature. This simple mistake could have taken his life.
						</p>
						<p>
							Fortunately for Aaron, the weather that day was odd. The temperature was colder during the afternoon than it was at night. Since the heater was on all day, the leaked CO built up and he felt symptoms as soon as he got home from work. The temperature warmed up at night, the heater went down, and a continued leak was prevented. That saved Aaron and his roommate from death.

						<hr class="co-yellow" />

						<p class="white-text padding top-40">
							A misplaced cover isn’t the only way CO can leak into a home. It is produced by fumes any time fuel is burned. Incomplete combustion is what produces CO, so it’s present anywhere there is a fire, including engines, grills, furnaces, and fireplaces.
						</p>
						<p class="h3-heading co-yellow-text padding top-40">
							Equipment failure and misrepair.
						</p>
						<p class="white-text">
							Incidents happen when apparatuses are installed wrong or working improperly. Anything from gas range stoves, clothes dryers, water heaters, generators or portable devices, and wood burning stoves are at risk.
						</p>
						<p class="h3-heading co-yellow-text padding top-40">
							Winter heater and appliance use.
						</p>
						<p class="white-text">
							Winter is one of the likeliest times for an incident due to excess heater usage or a power outage that leads people to using devices in the home. (Storms or any other power outage scenario are just as dangerous.)
						</p>
						<p class="h3-heading co-yellow-text padding top-40">
							A vehicle running in the garage
						</p>
						<p class="white-text">
							Vehicles in garages, or working improperly are hazards as well. Never leave a vehicle running in the garage, even if the door is open, and maintain vehicles and inspection so carbon monoxide can’t leak into your cabin.

							The next morning Aaron was still feeling ill. He called his mom to let her know of the situation, and told his roommate what was happening. "I’m not feeling good either," his roommate responded. Whenever he got home he felt fatigued and hit his head on the door before passing out himself. "Is that normal for you, because it isn’t for me," Aaron asked. That’s when it finally clicked that it could be CO.
						</p>
						<p>
							Both were virtually unaware of how deadly, quick, and unseen (without warning) CO poisoning could be. They opened all their doors and windows and called for someone to inspect the home. They felt immediately better after going outside.
						</p>
						<p>
						The situation wasn’t without its lesson. The roommates bought a detector that night. "That was just stupid," Aaron says. "Especially if you take into account how little it costs to have and for what it can protect against. It’s one thing to look after yourself, but if you have a whole family there that can be completely tragic."
						</p>
						<p>
						He encourages people to be cautious and aware. Simple things can lead to incidents, like a new roof being installed and a repairman knocking over a pipe. "They aren’t just saying these things save lives, they do."
